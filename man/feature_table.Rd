\description{
A `feature_table` is a normal form for simple features, where all branches are
recorded in one table with attributes object_, branch_, type_, parent_. All instances of parent_
are NA except for the holes in multipolygon.
}
\details{
There is wasted information stored this way, but that's because this is intended as a lowest common denominator format.

There are three tables, objects (the feature attributes and ID), branches (the parts),
coordinates (the X, Y, Z, M values).
}
